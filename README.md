# System-2
System but 2

This is very very WIP! (Literally started like 3 days ago)

I plan on this being like System from the outside, but it being completely different internally.


Of course it is 64bit and boots using BIOS.
And it mostly works on real hardware.

## Goals
 - Scheduler (working)
 - Elf loading (working)
 - User Space (working)
 - SMP (not added yet)
 - System Desktop / WM
 - idk more stuff


## How to build (Linux)
 - Install QEMU if you haven't.
 - Install GNU MAKE if you haven't.
 - Install GCC/LD if you haven't.
 - Install NASM if you haven't.


Go into the System Folder and run the `CRUN.sh` file
