    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.5.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Multiboot 2 protocol: Fix an issue where the 32-bit EFI Image Handle
          tag would be generated under 64-bit EFI and vice versa.
        - Do not set VirtualStart to PhysicalStart when generating the EFI
          memory map; set it to 0 instead.
        - Do not perform additional checks when loading relocatable ELF files
          after verifying that they are of type ET_DYN and have a PT_DYNAMIC
          segment. This ensures that certain relocatable ELF files that were
          previously misidentified as non-relocatable are recognised as such.

2024-05-22  mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 7.5.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.5.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix missing checks in the FAT filesystem driver that could cause
          divide-by-0 exceptions when parsing malformed/corrupted filesystems.
        - Limine boot protocol: Do not reject relocatable kernels with ELF PHDR
          load addresses at or around 0, instead slide them all the way to the
          topmost 2GiB (0xffffffff80000000). This allows setting a base load
          address of 0 in LD BFD/LLD linker scripts which makes LD BFD (the
          default GNU LD) actually emit an ELF with ET_DYN type.

          compared to base revision 1 being that it mandates bootloaders to
          support request delimiters.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix an issue regarding commit date parsing in the bootstrap script.

    Miscellaneous:
        - General documentation updates and improvements; split USAGE.md from

    *** Release 7.0.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.0.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix ARM64/aarch64 spinup code to properly support Apple Silicon
          chips.
        - Prevent users from building Limine with a GNU Make version older than
          4.2, as that is not supported, by gracefully erroring out with a
          useful error message.
        - Avoid usage of reserved C identifiers in certain cases.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Drop usage of "libgcc-binaries" for "cc-runtime". This finally makes
          us able to ship Limine tarballs without included binary blobs, and
          should improve compatibility with more obscure toolchain set ups.

    *** Release 7.0.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 6.20240107.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Minor fix of newline handling when reading user input lines.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Bump major version to 7. Note: There is no breaking change in 7.x
          compared to 6.x; the major version bump is done due to a change in
          the versioning scheme used by Limine (move to proper Semantic
          Versioning).
        - Fix versions of external dependencies in "bootstrap" script.
